# ðŸš€ My Web Development Journey Begins! 

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm MMA, and I'm excited to announce that I'm starting my journey into **web development**! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸŒŸ Why I'm Doing This
I've always been fascinated by how websites are built and how they bring ideas to life. Now, Iâ€™m diving in to learn the skills to create amazing things myself!

## ðŸ“– First Project: Personal Bio Page
To kick off this journey, I've created a **Personal Bio Page** using HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s a simple project, but itâ€™s the first step of many!
## ðŸš§ Whatâ€™s Next?
Iâ€™ll be learning more about:
- CSS for styling and responsive designs.
- JavaScript for interactivity.
- The MERN stack for building full-stack applications.

Follow along as I share my progress, challenges, and new projects. Iâ€™m open to feedback, so feel free to check out my repositories or drop me a message.

Letâ€™s build something amazing together! ðŸ’»âœ¨
